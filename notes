to start jetty:

java -jar jtty.jar 8080 .



Stories:

== Look and Feel ==
- I want to see a main screen with the main topic header
    - ux
- I want to see a menu when I click on the menu button on the topic header
    - ux
- I want to see a main screen with sub topics
    - ux
- I want to see a main screen with notes
    - ux
- I want to see a main screen with quick text
    - ux

== Data : Mock ==
- I want to load the main page with mock data
- I want to add a new sub topic
- I want to add a new note
- I want to edit a note with quick text
- I want to click on a subtopic and switch to that as the main topic

== Data : Database ==
- I want load the main page with database data
- I want to add a new sub topic and save it to the database
- I want to add a new note and save it to the database
- I want to edit a new note and save the edits to the database

MISC NOTES:
- 4 column panels
- Columns
    1: topic name / sub topic list / note list
    2: searched relevant items
    3: connected graph of all returned documents
    4: the actual document

 - short cuts for crypto mode
    - should just be a visual layer
    - used for blind text entry


 POSSIBLE SOLUTIONS:
 - canvas to draw lines from X to Y
 - css and html for the circles
 - smaller and larger circles, demo this?
 - simple annotator, scrape a target page for text, add annotations to particular tokens
 - assume static text that can be stored into your DB
 - problems: max page lengths
 - screen real estate vs fast context switching
    - switch between searching, navigating and reading information
 - hash tagging information, associate graph icon with the tag, very simple
    - names/people
    - specific items
    - everything else

 MOBILE UX and misc notes:
 - NOTE MODE:
    - you just see all the text of the note
    - you can unhook the columns by touch the left hand side
    - you can scroll up and down
    - bold up some text
    - tap on the note part to edit note
        - t reqs
        - Swipe, Tap

 - UNHOOK MODE:
    - tap one of the slightly reveal columns to go into that mode,
    - giant-ish [>] columns should allow the user to "discover more"
        - t reqs
        - tap

 - search mode
    - search > rest request > backend index request > backend ranking > respond with list request

 - socket io requests drive the front end animation
    - backend requests can trigger off front end animation


- subscription mode
    - implement feed-adapters

 - grid navigator mode
    - connected graph of notes
    - initially set to fan-out to the first set of nodes from main
    - with each addition of notes that people look at, their siblings nodes are all attached to the main graph
    - dotted connections will denote that a node has been shown, but its descendents are yet to be loaded
        - load a dotted node by tapping it
    - allows you to refocus whats at the center
    - t reqs
        - swipe, tap, pinch/zoom

 - design
    - flat + css noise
